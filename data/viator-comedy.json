    "description": "Join Old Town Trolley Tour's newest comedy tour – “Savannah for Morons”, a comedy show on wheels that roasts nearly 300 years of Savannah lore in 90 fun-filled minutes. A quirky, saucy and eccentric history lesson, perfect for morons and their (supposedly) smarter-ish friends, this tour features outrageously entertaining comedy skits, musical numbers, costume changes, a few absurd appearances, and loads of Savannah history.\n\nHosted by the infamous Moron Twins, Dannie and Danny Moron, this frolic around Savannah will give you all the inside gossip on practically every important moment that has transpired throughout Savannah’s deep, complex, and intoxicating (and intoxicated) past and present; from the founding of the colony of Georgia to the Civil War; from little known Paula Deen trivia to why every tourist must take a selfie on the Forrest Gump bench. \n\n*Please Note: This tour is NOT recommended for children under the age of 13.\n...
